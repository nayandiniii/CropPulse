# CropPulse
CropPulse 🌾is an android application developed by integrating ML &amp; IoT in order to focus on two SDG's  :  no hunger &amp; life on earth. Witht he help of this project we are trying to predict the health of crop using image analysis and also predicting the type of crop that can be grown in the particular region.


### Project Idea
CropPulse aims to provide farmers with a comprehensive solution for making informed decisions about their crops and soil. By combining image recognition for crop health monitoring, real-time sensor data for soil fertility management, and predictive analysis based on weather data, CropPulse empowers farmers to optimize their agricultural practices.

### Viability
The project's viability is supported by the use of readily available IoT technology, affordable hardware, and its potential to address real-world challenges faced by farmers.

### Relevance
In the context of increasing environmental concerns and global food security challenges, CropPulse is highly relevant. It aligns with the global sustainability agenda, contributing to SDG goals related to agriculture, hunger reduction, and responsible resource management.
